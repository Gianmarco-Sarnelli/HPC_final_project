MPI and SLURM explainations

#processes = #nodes * #cpu_per_node * #cores_per_cpu




MPIRUN options

-np <num> mpirun launches the given number of processes, as long as it will not oversubscribe a node.
    
-N <num> Launch num processes per node on all allocated nodes (synonym for npernode).

--map-by <foo>
    Map to the specified object, defaults to socket. Supported options include slot, hwthread, core, L1cache, L2cache, L3cache, socket, numa, board, node, sequential, distance, and ppr. Any object can include modifiers by adding a : and any combination of PE=n (bind n processing elements to each proc), SPAN (load balance the processes across the allocation), OVERSUBSCRIBE (allow more processes on a node than processing elements), and NOOVERSUBSCRIBE. This includes PPR, where the pattern would be terminated by another colon to separate it from the modifiers.
